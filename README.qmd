This Quarto format will help you create documents for journals published by Wiley. For more about producing LaTeX output for Wiley journals, see <https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/Prepare/new-journal-design.html>.

## Creating a New Article

You can use this as a template to create an article for one of the Wiley journals. To do this, use the following command:

`quarto use template ramiromagno/wiley-njd`

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file and bibiography that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Installation For Existing Document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command to install this format:

`quarto add ramiromagno/wiley-njd`
