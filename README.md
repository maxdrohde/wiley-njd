# Wiley’s New Journal Design (NJD) Latex Authoring Template

## Wiley’s New Journal Design (NJD)

This Quarto format will help you create documents for journals published
by Wiley. For more about producing LaTeX output for Wiley journals, see
<https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/Prepare/new-journal-design.html>.

## Creating a New Article

You can use this as a template to create an article for one of the Wiley
journals. To do this, use the following command:

`quarto use template ramiromagno/wiley-njd`

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file and
bibiography that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Installation For Existing Document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or
document. From the quarto project or document directory, run the
following command to install this format:

`quarto add ramiromagno/wiley-njd`
